Attendance link notifier

This application is specifically designed for students who dont want to listen to class and yet want attendance
this application only recognizes google form's attendance links(my university's choise)

this is my first attempt at a user interfaceable script
u can downlaod the executable file from here https://github.com/shivanandham/attendance/releases/tag/1.0
install the file where u have access to coz its not a windows application and wont show up in start menu
you have to manually go to the saved location to run it
once installed, go to the installed folder and u can find attendance_link_notifier.exe 
run it and follow on screen instructions

opening up the message box is mandatory coz its not running on an api, it detects the link via scanning the screeen like a human does
so dont clutter or hide the message box, the link when posted must be visible

for queries, feel free to cantact me thru instagram https://www.instagram.com/i_a_m_root/

will try my best to keep it updated and resolve bugs
